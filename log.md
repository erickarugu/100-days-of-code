# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: March 21, Saturday 

**Today's Progress**: Microservices and APIs Projects on freecodecamp. 
Created a URL Shortener Microservice using MongoDB and Node.js. Learnt how to play with GET and PUT action methods to create API endpoints. I didn't work on the FrontEnd though ^ 0 ^

**Thoughts:** The challenge was tricky and eye opening. Redirecting to the original url from the shortened url was a tussle that kept me stuck for almost 30 minutes only to discover the solution was one line of code.

**Article(s)**:
Today I read an interesting article "Learn to Code From Home: The Coronavirus Quarantine Developer Skill Handbook
" by [Quincy Larson](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/author/quincylarson/) the founder of [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) on how to take advantage of the freely available learning resources and level up your Dev Skills during this quarantine period. In the article, he shared a couple of these resources and I will be visiting them in the course of my journey.

### Day 1: March 22, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Started and finished the Data Visualization Certification challenges on freecodecamp. I will start working on the projects soon.

**Thoughts**: I enjoyed learning how to use the D3.js Javascript library. Finally, I learnt how to create a pie chart and bar graph using JS! Also started learning how to use AJAX to work with APIs still on the Data Visualization path.

### Day 1: March 22, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Created a Timestamp Microservice that returns the passed timestamp in JSON format
