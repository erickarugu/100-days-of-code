# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: March 21, Saturday 

**Today's Progress**: Microservices and APIs Projects on freecodecamp. 
Created a URL Shortener Microservice using MongoDB and Node.js. Learnt how to play with GET and PUT action methods to create API endpoints. I didn't work on the FrontEnd though ^ 0 ^

**Thoughts:** The challenge was tricky and eye opening. Redirecting to the original url from the shortened url was a tussle that kept me stuck for almost 30 minutes only to discover the solution was one line of code.

### Day 0: March 21, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
